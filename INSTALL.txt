florb uses OMake (http://omake.metaprl.org) for a build system.

To build florb simply change into the 'src' directory and run

    omake

You can change the default installation prefix (/usr) by specifying a custom prefix like so:

    omake PREFIX=/usr/local

If you have all the required dependencies installed, this will build florb. Install like this:

    omake install

And you're done...
